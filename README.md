## Introduction
Path of Exile is a popular online action role-playing game set in a dark and gritty fantasy world called Wraeclast. Players take on the role of an exile, exploring the world and defeating enemies to earn experience points and loot that can be used to improve their characters' skills and equipment. The game features a deep and complex skill tree, allowing for customizable characters and unique builds. Path of Exile is known for its challenging gameplay, deep lore, and frequent updates, and is free to play with optional microtransactions.

## Currency
The currency system in Path of Exile revolves around a variety of different orbs and scrolls. Each currency item serves a specific function in the crafting and enhancement of a character's equipment, or allowing restructuring of the character's passive skill tree. In addition, players utilize these currency items to exchange items with each other in the game.

## Skill Gems
Skill Gems, also known as Active Skill Gems, are items that provide players with new abilities when placed into an item socket. These gems come in different levels and quality variants that can increase their power. 

## Divination cards
A divination card is a type of item that can be collected to exchange for a reward. There are many different cards, each one dropping in a different part of the game and granting a different reward.

## Bosses / Pinnacle bosses
In Path of Exile, a boss is a powerful enemy that typically appears at the end of a section of the game, such as a map or a labyrinth. Bosses are often much stronger and more difficult to defeat than regular enemies, and usually have unique mechanics and abilities that players need to learn in order to successfully defeat them.

Bosses in Path of Exile also have a chance to drop valuable items such as unique items, currency items, or rare crafting materials. As a result, many players focus on defeating bosses as a way to progress their characters and acquire better gear.

## In-Game Profit
In Path of Exile, there are multiple ways to earn currency or make a profit, including leveling and corrupting gems, flipping divination cards or currencies with vendors, and defeating bosses that have a percentage chance to drop valuable items. This code or Google sheet provides detailed information on these methods.
